Scale:- Comparing between nearly 3 Billion and 200 Million Rows in 30 minutes
∗ Conceptualized our first configurable data quality tools which fortified data integrity for pipelines.
∗ Optimized parallel data reading, leading to a 60-pct reduction in data (>100GB) processing time, enabling
developers to perform real-time data validation and trend analysis for voluminous datasets.
∗ EQ Tracer: A tool to monitor summative metric trends across configurable hierarchies with dynamic alerting
mechanisms to filter out noise data, ensuring accurate insights.
∗ Ratio Tracer: A tool for outlier detection using customizable percentile thresholds, enabling the proactive
identification and mitigation of anomalies.
∗ PM Tracer: A logging and monitoring tool that aggregates data from multiple sources, providing detailed
coverage and mismatch analysis for enhanced data quality and system reliability.
◦ Spark Submit Orchestrator Stack:- Bash, SQL
∗ Developed an orchestrator for Spark submissions and PySpark scripts, dynamically fetching configuration from
MySQL. This centralizes and tracks job configurations, while providing data for performance monitoring.
